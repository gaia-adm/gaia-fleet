Description=Gaia sample weather processor
Documentation=https://github.com/gaia-adm/sample-weather-processor
# HACK: Dependency ordering due to lack of Amazon elastic file system. We require
# result-upload-service.service to be started already and run on the same machine.
After=result-upload-service.service

[Service]
# Let processes take awhile to start up (for first run Docker containers)
# Large start timeout is to allow for pulling down Docker images from Registry
TimeoutStartSec=20min
TimeoutStopSec=15

# Change killmode from "control-group" to "none" to let Docker remove
# work correctly.
KillMode=none

# Get CoreOS environmental variables
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment

# Restart policy
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=20s

# Pre-start and Start
## Directives with "=-" are allowed to fail without consequence
ExecStartPre=-/bin/mkdir /upload
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker stop sample-weather-processor
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm sample-weather-processor
# This is due to bug in which multiple docker pulls might collide in case of the same base image
# Bug had been reported here: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9718
# This issue still exists in Docker 1.8.1
# for now - we sync the collided services (evi, mgs and sts) using flock
